# K-Unity-Yamae Upgrade Report

**Date:** June 11, 2026

## Completed Upgrade Themes

| Theme | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Codex and Claude usability | `install`, `init-agent`, project-local skills, and CLI entrypoints are available |
| LazyCodex-style handoff | `local-patch` and `run --patch-file proposed.diff --guarded-agent-patch` support patch-first guarded execution |
| Unity production context | Rule cards, risk model, context pack, UI/graphics/architecture facts, and manual check prompts are wired |
| Editor inspection | Probe source can emit inspector listeners, missing references, prefab overrides, and UI component state |
| Desktop integration diagnostics | `providers doctor` reports Codex/Claude desktop and CLI entrypoint readiness through local file checks |
| Release operability | `release-check --json` reports package data and required quality gates |

## Remaining High-Value Work

1. Add richer Codex CLI and Claude CLI orchestration examples that still run through local skills and guarded patch handoff.
2. Expand Unity Editor probe coverage for Addressables, animation controller transitions, material/shader variants, and prefab override value diffs.
3. Add packaging metadata for a distributable wheel and optional Codex plugin bundle.
4. Add golden fixture projects for URP/HDRP, mobile texture compression, localization tables, Addressables, and large UI prefab sets.
5. Add CI that runs release-check, pytest, ruff, and source-level Editor probe compilation checks.

## Recommended Operating Mode

For live-service Unity projects, keep the default loop lightweight:

```bash
kunity-yamae scan
kunity-yamae run "task" --plan-only --verify-dry-run --editor-probe
kunity-yamae run "task" --agent local-patch --patch-file proposed.diff --guarded-agent-patch
kunity-yamae verify --dry-run
```

Only run Unity batchmode compile, EditMode, PlayMode, or build validation when the risk score, touched files, or release gate requires it.
